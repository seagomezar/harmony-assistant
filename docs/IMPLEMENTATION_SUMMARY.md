- **Error tracking** with detailed stack traces
- **Correlation IDs** for request tracing
- **External analytics integration** (Google Analytics, Mixpanel)
- **Environment-specific log levels** 
- **Analytics event categories**: Chat, AI, Product, System, Performance

### Usage:
```javascript
import logger, { trackEvent, ANALYTICS_EVENTS } from './app/services/logger.server.js';

// Basic logging
logger.info('User action completed', { userId: '123' });

// Analytics events
trackEvent(ANALYTICS_EVENTS.CHAT_SESSION_STARTED, {
  conversationId: 'conv_123',
  userId: 'user_456'
});

// Performance tracking
trackPerformance('database_query', 150, { operation: 'user_lookup' });
```

## 4. Render Deployment

### Files Created/Modified:
- `docs/RENDER_DEPLOYMENT.md` - Complete Render deployment guide
- Updated `Dockerfile` - Improved with health checks and optimization
- Environment templates include Render-specific configuration

- **Multi-environment support** (development, staging, production)
- **Database setup** with PostgreSQL configuration
- **Scaling strategies** and performance optimization
- **Monitoring and alerting** setup instructions
- **Security best practices** for production deployment
- **Cost optimization** recommendations
- **Troubleshooting guide** for common issues

### Usage:
1. Set up Render service using the documentation
2. Configure environment variables from templates
3. Deploy using automated scripts or GitHub Actions
4. Monitor using built-in health checks

## Documentation Structure

### Main Documentation:
- `docs/ENVIRONMENT_MANAGEMENT.md` - Environment setup and best practices
- `docs/SHOPIFY_DEPLOYMENT.md` - Shopify deployment process and automation
- `docs/RENDER_DEPLOYMENT.md` - Render.com deployment guide
- `docs/ANALYTICS_LOGGING.md` - Logging and analytics implementation

### Scripts:
- `scripts/setup-env.sh` - Interactive environment setup
- `scripts/deploy.sh` - Automated deployment with validation

### CI/CD:
- `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml` - Complete CI/CD pipeline

## Developer Experience Improvements

### Onboarding Process:
1. **Clone repository**
2. **Run setup script**: `./scripts/setup-env.sh development`
3. **Install dependencies**: `npm install`
4. **Start development**: `npm run dev`

### Deployment Process:
1. **Test locally**: All validations pass
2. **Deploy to staging**: `./scripts/deploy.sh staging`
3. **Test staging**: Verify functionality
4. **Deploy to production**: `./scripts/deploy.sh production`
5. **Monitor**: Health checks and analytics

### Configuration Management:
- Environment-specific templates
- Automatic validation
- Type-safe access
- Security best practices

## Monitoring and Analytics

### Built-in Monitoring:
